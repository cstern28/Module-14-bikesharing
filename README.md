## Purpose
The purpose of this dashboard is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 

## Results
See the screenshot images below for each graph on dashboard and the description of the graph below the image.

### Checkout Times for Users

This shows that 145,000 bike trips are 5 minutes or less. There are very few trip durations that are greater than 1 or 2 hours. This means that most people use the citibikes for a short duration of time under 1 hour.

### Checkout Times by Gender

The majority of bike trips are by males verses females. There were about 108,000 males that took a bike trip of 6 minutes, whereas only 33 females that took a bike trip of 5 minutes. This means the business should cater to males, which is the target market.

### Trips by Weekday per Hours

This shows that bike trips typically occur between the hours of 7AM and 7PM, with the most popular hours being between 5-6PM on a weekday (specifically, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays).


### Trips by Gender (Weekday per hours)

This shows another graph where males are using the bike more often than females, specically between 7AM-9AM and 5PM-6PM. For example, there were about 30,000 bikes rode by males on Thursday at 5PM based on the visual graph.

### User Trips by Gender and Usertype

This shows that mostly male subscribers to the citibike program are the customers frequently using the bikes throughout the week. For example, about 259,000 bikes were taken out by male subscribers on Thursdays.

### Gender Breakdown

This shows than 1.5 million males ue the citibikes. 588,000 users are females. 

### Average Trip Duration by Age

This shows that majority of citibike users are in midtown or downtown manhattan and not that many users in the boroughs of New York City.

## Summary 
Overall, the results show that citibikes are very successful in the city and mostly males are the primary users who have subscriptions. Bike are mostly used during the weekdays between 7AM and 7PM. It's difficult to conclude whether the Des Moines business proposal would be successful because the city design is different from New York City and the lifestyles/cultures are different. I believe it shows potential for a successful business proposal, but I would need data from more citys that are comparable to Des Moines based on city size, population, etc. I would like to see a bar graph comparing the city size and also a line graph to compare the populations & population growth between Des Moines and New York City to understand whether the data is comparable to draw a conclusion for whether the business plan is solid.
